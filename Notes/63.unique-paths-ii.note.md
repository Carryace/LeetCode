# Unique Path II Note

## Initial Idea
Basically, it is a solution with a little transofrm from `unique-paths` problem (issue 62), just need to add a few constrains when initializing our `pathCount` array considering the obstable provided:
- On first row / first column
  - first row: if there is a obstacle at (0, i), all the points after (0, i) on the column, eg. (0, i+1), (0, i+2)... will be set to 0
  - first column: if there is an obstable at (j, 0), all the points after (j, 0) on the column, eg. (j+1, 0) ... will be set to 0
- On rows/columns afterwards
  - check if it is obstable
    - set `pathCount(i, j)` to 0 if (i, j) is an obstacle
    - add up `pathCount(i-1, j) + pathCount(i, j-1)` and set to `pathCount(i, j)` if (i, j) is not an obstacle

## What Went Wrong
Used the same logic to handle the first row/ first column as unique-path-I, need to update the logic as above to resolve the failed test cases.
