# Next Permutation Notes

## Initial Idea 
To understand the real relationship in the permutation, we need to go through
couple of example to explore the math there:

> [1,2,3,4,3,2,1] -> [1,2,4,1,2,3,3] 

> [1,2,3,2,1,2,3,4] -> [1,2,3,2,1,2,4,3]

I think the key is the last sumit or last valley of the whole numbers array, based on the last sumit or valley, I had this basic logic here:

- if there is no sumit or valley in the array, thenthe array itself should be a sorted order, either acs or dec
  - ACS: swap the last two unique num in the arr, eg [1,2,3,3] -> [1,3,2,3]
  - DEC: revert the whole array, eg [3,2,1] -> [1,2,3]
- if the array ends with a sumit
  - It needs to find the smallest number from nums[lastSumitIndex - 1] ~ nums[end of arr]
  - Put the smallest number to nums[lastSumitIndex - 1]
  - Swap original nums[lastSumitIndex - 1] to the correct place to form a DEC order
  - Revert the nums from [lastSumitIndex, end of arr]
- if the array ends with a valley
  - Find the last two unique number from nums[lastValleyIndex - 1] ~ nums[end of arr]

## Revised Idea
This problem can be solve from the idea mentioned in Initial Idea Section with `O(n)` time complexity,
however, it is not the most optimized case. We actually can find a way to get rid of sumit or valley discussion above.

because we know that it is not possible to have a next generation for DEC sorted numbers array, so
all we need is to loop from the end of arr and find the first decreasing numbers:
- Start from the last index of the array, compare it with previous element in the list
  - Stop until the previous is smaller than current, record the current index
- Find the first num that is larger than nums[crtIndex], and swap them
- reverse from crtIndex+1 to end of arr



## Where went wrong
Although the initial idea is great, but ailed too many times, plus the implementation could be optimized.
- Can add in helper functions like `reverse()` and `swap()` to have a clearer implementation
- Failed at boundary case when reverse in the ends with sumit implementation
- Forgot to discuss if multiple elements are the same when arr ends with valley implementation
