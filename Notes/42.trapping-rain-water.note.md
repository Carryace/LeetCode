# Trapping Rain Water Notes

## Initial Idea
I kind of remembered this solution idea, might have done this a little while ago.
Basically, we need to figure at each num in the arr, see if it is able to hold up
some water. Then, how much water it can hold:
- if Math.min(leftMax, rightMax) - crtNum, then it can hold up to: 
  $$ (Math.min(leftMax, rightMax) - crtNum) * 1 $$
  - leftMax: max num from nums[0 ~ crt]
  - rightMax: max num from nums[crt ~ nums.length - 1]
- else, it can hold 0
