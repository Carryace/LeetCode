# Unique Paths Note

## Initial Idea
Two ideas popped up for me:
1. The brute-force one
   -  Use DFS to find all the routes that can reach the right bot corner from top left starter point
   -  Count the total routes
2. DP solution:
   - `p(i,j)` means the total unique paths from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)`
   - Based on above definition, derive a formula to calculate `p(i, j)`, we actually have two ways to reach to point `(i, j)` since we are only allowed to move right or bottom
     - From `(i-1, j) -> (i, j)`
     - From `(i, j-1) -> (i, j)`
   - Then we will have this formula: 
   $$p(i-1,j) + p (j-1, i) = p(i, j)$$
   - For initial case, we will have the top and left boundary set to 1, because all of them will only have one way to reach to
   - Then, start from top left corner, we loop from right to left, top to bottom, and return `p(m-1, n-1)` as the final result

## What Went Wrong
Javascript Two dimensional array initialized in a wrong way, here is the correction:

`let arr = new Array(m)`
